       " 'Macintosh SCSI Termination\\nby the Engineering Department of\\nMicroNet Technology, Inc.\\n \\nDated:  11/1/90\\n \\n \\nWhat is Termination?\\n \\nTermination involves the placement of impedance matching circuits on the bus.\\nIn the case of SCSI, these circuits are typically placed at each end of the\\nSCSI Bus (cable). These circuits are known as \"Thevenin Terminators\" and are\\nsimple resistor networks in the case of SCSI.  These resistor circuits are\\ncomposed of a 220 ohm resistor connected to Vcc and the signal node, while a\\n330 ohm resistor is connected to ground and the signal node.  One of these\\nresistor pairs is connected to each of the 18 active signal lines.  The Vcc (+5\\nnominal) for the terminators is typically provided by line 26 on the SCSI bus\\ncable.  In practice, however, this voltage is sometimes supplied by the SCSI\\ndevice (hard disk)  directly to the terminator circuit if the circuit resides\\non the device itself.  In this case, Vcc on line 26 of the SCSI would not be\\nrequired.\\n \\nWhy Terminate?\\n \\nTerminating a SCSI bus preserves high transition speeds, and when properly\\nplaced will clean up the signal along the entire length of the line.  They also\\nprovide a reasonable degree of noise immunity.  The most important reason to\\nterminate an SCSI bus is that termination is required for the bus to work!  The\\nANSI SCSI specification calls for the bus to be terminated in the way described\\nabove.\\n \\nHow to Properly Terminate a SCSI Bus\\n \\nA SCSI bus is properly terminated by placing bus terminators at each end of the\\nbus.  There are a couple of exceptions.  If the bus is very short (ie. 18\" or\\nless) then generally it is best to terminate just one end.  Also, if the cable\\nlength (6 meters maximum) between two devices is greater than 10 feet then the\\ncable should be terminated at the 10 foot point in addition to each end.  When\\ndaisy chaining three or more SCSI devices the bus will often exceed this 10\\nfoot specification and will require three terminators in the chain to work\\nproperly.\\n \\nPhysically, terminators generally have three forms in the Macintosh world.\\nElectrically, these three types of terminators are equivalent and vary only in\\nwhere and how they are installed.\\n \\nFirst, are the ON-DRIVE terminators which are known as resistor packs (or sips,\\nor dips).  They reside right on the device (hard disk) itself and are almost\\nalways removable.  Always note the orientation of these parts before attempting\\nto remove these!  They have a polarity and must not be inserted backwards.\\n \\nSecond, there are the terminator blocks or plugs.  These are short \"plug like\"\\ndevices and are inserted between a hard drive cabinetÕs SCSI connector and the\\nSCSI cable or on the second cabinet connector if one exists.  DonÕt confuse\\nthese with the ON-DRIVE terminators described above.  ON-DRIVE means literally\\nthat, on the drive (HDA) not on the cabinet.\\n \\nThird, are the \"Mother Board\" Terminators.  These may look like a SIMM or they\\nmay look like a narrow plug.  They are used ONLY when there is no ÔinternalÕ\\nhard drive in the Macintosh AND you are connecting an external SCSI device\\n(hard drive) with an SCSI cable longer than 18\".\\n \\nThey are inserted into the 50 pin SCSI connector inside the Macintosh where the\\ncable for an internal drive would normally connect.  These Mother Board\\nTerminators are keyed (a polarity notch) and must never be inserted backwards!\\n \\nNever use the second type of terminator when the drive inside a cabinet has\\nterminators installed on it.\\n \\nCommon Termination Problems\\n \\nPoor Quality Cables.  Always use cables which are double shielded (foil and\\nbraid).  Apple and MicroNet brand SCSI cables are built with specifications\\nthat include twisted pair and double shielding.  Never use simple printer type\\nRS232 cables!  Make sure the connector hoods (or shrouds) are each connected to\\nthe shield braid!\\n \\nToo Many SCSI Devices Terminated.  Only the last SCSI device (disk drive/tape\\ndrive/scanner/printer) should be terminated.  If the Macintosh has no hard disk\\ndrive installed inside it, then a Mother Board Terminator should be installed\\nif the cable to the external device is longer than 18\". MicroNet Technology\\ndeveloped what is called the \"MBT\", which can be used to terminate the\\nMacintosh SE, SE/30, II, IIx, IIcx, IIci when an internal hard disk drive is\\nnot present and is available through MicroNet resellers.\\n \\nTotal SCSI Cabling Exceeds 6 Meters (19.6\\').  The total length of all cables\\nused (added together) must not be greater than 6 meters.  DonÕt forget to add\\nthe internal cabinet wiring which is generally about 1 foot.\\n \\nNever use a plug type terminator designed for installation on a cabinet\\nconnector if the SCSI device (hard disk drive or tape drive) inside the cabinet\\nalready has terminators installed on the drive!\\n \\nNever Exceed the Maximum Cabling Length of 6 Meters (19.6 feet) Total.  Never\\nmix cable brands, types or styles.  This is a common source of trouble.  Each\\ncable has a different type of construction, impedance and wire placement which\\ncan result in bus reflections.  In mixed cable configurations some devices may\\nsimply not work even if all other guidelines are followed!\\n \\nMacintosh and The SCSI Reset Line and On-Drive and Off-Drive Termination\\n \\nPin 40 of the 50 pin SCSI connector is the hardware reset line.  When the\\nMacintosh is first turned on (cold boot time) it repeatedly asserts this reset\\nline in order to reset all attached SCSI devices.  Generally, this poses no\\nproblem.  Some non-block devices can have trouble recovering from this reset\\ncondition and cause other attached devices to have trouble.  Most notable are\\nolder SCSI scanners and tape drives.  The most common symptom of this problem\\nis a Macintosh that wonÕt boot from a hard drive when a scanner or tape drive\\nis attached to the same cable. This problem can also occur when using some of\\nthe first generation SCSI hard disks.  They will enter a ÔUnit AttentionÕ mode\\nand will not respond to read or write commands until a ÔRequest SenseÕ SCSI\\ncommand is issued by the Macintosh.  Newer drives will simply abort the Unit\\nAttention condition after it receives several read or write commands and\\neventually will respond to the data requests.  Symptoms of this later problem\\nwill be a drive which will not show up on the desktop the first time the\\nMacintosh is booted but will show up fine the second time around. It should\\nalso be noted that whenever a SCSI device is first powered on it also enters\\nthis Unit Attention condition.  The symptom for this is again a drive which\\nwill not show up on the desktop (mount) the first time the Macintosh is booted.\\nThe purpose of the Unit Attention condition is to alert the Host (Macintosh)\\nthat an important event has occurred which the host should be aware of before\\naccessing that device.  The Host is then supposed to ask the SCSI device what\\noccurred by using the Request Sense command.  The Host would then act take an\\nappropriate action before making data requests of the device.  A good example\\nof this scenario is the resultant Unit Attention condition which follows the\\nswapping of media on a removable media device, such as an optical cartridge\\ndevice.  It should be obvious why the host should be alerted to this swap\\nbefore it \"writes data to the newly inserted cartridge\"!  The Unit Attention\\ncondition following the swap would prompt the Host (Macintosh) to determine\\nwhat event has caused the device to respond with a Unit Attention condition.\\nWhen the Host (Macintosh) follows up with a Request Sense command it then\\nlearns of the cartridge swap and takes appropriate action.  In this case it\\ngrays out or removes the icon on the desktop and mounts the new cartridge.\\n \\nHardware resets and drive power being turned off and then on again are\\nconsidered important events. That is why they cause most SCSI devices to enter\\nthe Unit Attention condition. Older Macintoshes have trouble with devices which\\nenter the Unit Attention condition because they donÕt follow up and  query the\\ndevice to find out the reason for the condition. Therefore, if the device\\ndoesnÕt clear the condition itself, the MacintoshÕs data requests will not be\\nhonored and the result can be a drive which wonÕt boot reliably or at all.  The\\nfix for these types of problems is simply to cut the reset line somewhere in\\nthe cabling (line 40 at the 50 pin end).\\n \\nMany subsystem manufacturers have taken this approach successfully.  While this\\napproach remains debatable it can be the only remedy for severe cases.  While\\nit wonÕt stop devices from entering Unit Attention conditions at power up time,\\nit will stop the hardware resets issued by Macintoshes at boot time from\\nreaching the device.  This can make the difference in booting and not booting!\\n \\nThe reason this topic is being presented here in a discussion on termination is\\nthat it is all important that the reset line (pin 40) always be terminated!  If\\nit is not, the device will be constantly resetting itself and will not work!\\nNormally this is never a problem since line 40 is one of the 18 active signal\\nlines which normally get terminated.  But if you are working with a device\\nwhich has line 40 cut inside its cabinet, AND you remove the ON-DRIVE\\nterminators in favor of an ON CABINET (external) terminator then line 40 wonÕt\\nbe terminated since the cabling inside the cabinet has this line cut.\\nTherefore, pin 40 on the drive wonÕt be terminated since this line is open and\\nwonÕt reach the terminator which is now on the outside of the cabinet!\\n \\nThe warning here is simply to verify continuity of line 40 on a cabinetÕs\\ninternal cabling before determinating the drive inside it.  If line 40 has been\\ncut on the cabling inside a drive cabinet YOU CANÕT DETERMINATE THE DRIVE\\nITSELF unless you change the internal cabling to pass line 40 through to the\\noutside connector of the cabinet!\\n \\nEnough of these type of cabinets exist in the world that it is a real problem\\nwhen reconfiguring bus termination.  Another approach to handling a case like\\nthis is to put this drive (or device) on the end of the SCSI which should be\\nterminated anyway and donÕt use an external terminator on the bus at all. If,\\nhowever, you have more than one of these devices with line 40 cut inside its\\ncabinet then you must consider changing their internal cable if you wish to\\ndeterminate the drive (device) inside it and use external ÔplugÕ type\\nterminators.\\n \\nMacintosh Configurations and Termination Issues\\n \\nPoint #1)  DonÕt Be a Worry Wart\\n \\nThere is a lot of bad advice floating around.  The purist will tell you that if\\nyou have more than two SCSI devices terminated on the bus you will blow up your\\nMacintosh. This simply isnÕt true. If you have a third terminated device on the\\nbus or even (heaven forbid) a fourth you are not going to pop the SCSI chip in\\nyour Macintosh. In some cases with older SCSI drives it may be necessary to\\nleave the ON-DRIVE terminators in place in order for them to power up and to\\nwork at all.\\n \\nAnother purist might tell you that both ends of a SCSI bus MUST be terminated\\nin order for anything to work.  This again is junk talking.  Take for example\\nthe fact that Apple doesnÕt terminate the mother board of certain Macintosh\\ncomputers!  If there is no internal drive in these Macintosh computers it\\nsimply never gets terminated like it should be (hence the  recent availability\\nof mother board terminators from MicroNet Technology, Inc., and Apple\\nthemselves).  And since these Macintosh computers are always one end of the\\nSCSI bus one might ask the purist why any SCSI devices work at all if there is\\nno internal drive! The fact is that if the cable is fairly short (18\" to 6\\')\\nthe Macintosh SCSI bus will generally function fine even if the Macintosh isnÕt\\nterminated.  However, the faster Macintosh computers, like the IIci and the\\nIIfx may need internal termination inorder for them to work properly.\\n \\nThe pursuit of the Perfect SCSI bus can be elusive.  As soon as you add SCSI\\ndevices from different vendors and use the different cables supplied by each,\\nyou have a potential problem.\\n \\nMixing cable types, lengths, and styles is an invitation to trouble.  But in\\nthe real world, there isnÕt much choice!  This is largely why switching cables\\naround and trying cables of different lengths has solved many problems.  A part\\nof configuring SCSI peripherals will always be determined empirically.\\n \\n \\nQuestions and Answers\\n \\nQ)  Should I ever remove the ON-DRIVE terminators from a drive which is\\ninstalled inside a Macintosh?\\nA)  NO.\\n \\n \\nQ)  Should I ever use a Mother Board Terminator if there is a drive installed\\ninside the Macintosh?\\nA)  NO. You canÕt !  Each plugs into the same 50 pin connector on the mother\\nboard and you know what they say about two pieces of matter occupying the same\\nspace!\\n \\n \\nQ)  What is a ÔBlack terminatorÕ and when should I use it?\\nA)  The black terminator is a product from Apple and is for use only with the\\nMacintosh IIfx.  It is an external plug type terminator and would only be used\\nÔwhere and whenÕ a normal external plug type terminator would be used!  This\\nblack terminator differs (electrically) only slightly from a normal plug type\\nterminator and not physically.  ItÕs purpose in life is to compensate for some\\nchanges in the new SCSI chip used in the Macintosh IIfx.  If later models of\\nthe Macintosh use this new SCSI chip then it is likely to be recommended for\\nthose machines as well.\\n \\n \\n   Prepared by the Engineering Department of\\n   MicroNet Technology, Inc.\\n   20 Mason\\n   Irvine, CA  92718\\n   TEL: (714) 837-6033\\n   FAX: (714) 837-1164\\n \\n \\n \\nCopyright 1990 by MicroNet Technology, Inc.\\n \\n ']"
